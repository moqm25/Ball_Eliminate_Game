# Ball_Eliminate_Game

This Ball Eimination Game has 50 balls which are bouncing around on the screen. There is a user-controlled evil circle which will attempt to eat all the bouncy balls. Whenever the evil circle touches the bouncy ball, that bouncy ball is eliminated. The number of balls remaining is shown in the top right of the display. 

Make sure all the files {Ball_Game.html, main.js, style.css} are located in the same directory. 
Open the *Ball_Game.html* file to play the game.
